While employed as a developer and researcher I have had been lucky enough to have had lots of experiences in the UK education system both teaching and on working on projects. I have had contact with students through teaching Advance Database Systems and Visual Programming at the University of Bolton and by supervised MSc and BSc students. Supervising students on a one-to-one basis has been my favourite part of this experience. I have also helped to develop software to support projects and students.I have <a href="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/papers-and-writing/">written various papers on learning technology.</a>
