Neighbours is an Australian documentary following the lives of the residents of Ramsey Street. Kangaroos roam the streets while young surfers drunk on fosters try their not to ride into during skateboard races.

This is captured perfectly in the Neighbours Video game that was released on the Commodore 64 in the late 1980's when Neighbours was at its peak.
