The Cloudworks team have been developing an API for Cloudworks to allow developers to create their own visualizations, programs and mash ups. The API currently supports calls to get data and I found this is a great opportunity to test different ways of visualizing and organising the resources within cloudworks for the Design Bash 2010. Sheila MacNeill has created a cloud to store and discuss <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/cloud/view/4116">Cloudworks API tests</a>, my test demos can be found there and the cloud works team are encouraging developers to get stuck in and have a go.

If you would like to play with the API yourself and add your own demos you will need to get an API by signing up to Cloudworks and contacting <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/user/view/1040">Nick Freear</a>. There is some excellent <a href="http://cloudworks.ac.uk/uploads/documentation/Cloudworks_API.pdf">documentation</a> on using the API already made available by the Cloudworks team and Nick was happy to provide example code, his PHP example can be seen here (don't forget to change the user agent/api key/cloud id):

<em>Edit: Removed the code since the best place to grab a PHP example is <a href="http://snipplr.com/view/37644/cloudworks-api-demo/"> Nicks snippler. </a> </em>

This should get you up and running and is pretty self-explanatory. I hope to turn my demos into something more useful and post some specific examples of things that can be achieved using the Cloudworks API.
