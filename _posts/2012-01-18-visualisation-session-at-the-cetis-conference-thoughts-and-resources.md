We are 34 days away from the <a href="http://wiki.cetis.ac.uk/Conference_2012_Programme">CETIS conference</a>. On day two I have signed up to a session on <a href="http://wiki.cetis.ac.uk/Social_Network_Analysis">Social Network Analysis and Data Visualisation</a> being run by Sheila and Lorna. I'm really looking forward to the session as recently <a href="http://www.davidsherlock.info/notes/patternsandvisualisation">I have been thinking about visualisations</a>, what they mean and how they can be used in the most effective manner and I have found understanding them quite difficult. I am only just getting my head around the area and hope that the session might be a hub for the experienced to share some of their protips. I thought that by airing some of my questions and sharing some favourite resources might be a good way to get the tips rolling in and a conversation going before the event. I guess that everybody at the session will have his or her own interests and questions and I would be interested to know what these are.
<h3>Tips please</h3>
Some of the questions I have:
<ul>
	<li>When are visualisations useful, when are they not and what makes a good visualisation?</li>
	<li>When is a visualisation more then a bunch of lines connecting things?</li>
	<li>What models sit behind the visualisation?</li>
	<li>How do you find and validate good data, particularly data about social networks?</li>
	<li>What are the most effective ways of visualisation, any tips on development environment?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Resources</h3>
I’d also be grateful for any resources you think might be useful. I’ll start with two I’m working with at the moment.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/arc12/Text-Mining-Weak-Signals/wiki">A github repository </a> belonging to Adam Cooper with examples to find emergent trends and “weak signals” in paper abstracts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Statistical_Analysis:_an_Introduction_using_R">A handy book</a> that aims to “introduce the principles of statistics and modern statistical analysis for a non-mathematical audience”. Does it well and introduces R at the same time.</li>
</ul>
Looking forward to the session and a protip from me:
