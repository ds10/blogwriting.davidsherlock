As per the very long title, this is a Visual Basic for Application that will loop through directory of CSVs and create separate PowerPoint presentations for each file script which I am saving this for future reference.Â  VBA script to loop through directory of CSVs and create separate PowerPoint presentations for each file based on the contents of the CSV. Because many of the questions in my CSV have a comma I have used ; as a delimiter, I set this when exporting from my original data source (MySQL) , but you can also change the delimiter in OpenOffice without messing with the operating system.
