I am really surprised at how easy it is to create content on the web that is Oculus Rift compatible. I've been using a small software program called <a href="https://github.com/Instrument/oculus-bridge">Oculus Bridge</a> to get tracking information to the browser (via websockets) and a WebGL library called <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a> to make 3D worlds. While playing with three.js  I came across a a <a href="http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/">library of three.js extensions</a> which are apparently very easily to incorporate in to your existing projects.

One of these extensions was a Nyan Cat; so to demonstrate to a student how 'pick up and play' the Oculus Rift really is I set out to create a 3d  Nyan cat world with them. It took us about 30 mins, most of the time spent getting our heads around how three.js likes to do things. I'm planning to create a 3D universe of flying cats for the Rift before I post it up for people to play with themselves, but since I don't have time at the moment to finish things off  here is a video of me playing with how far I got:
