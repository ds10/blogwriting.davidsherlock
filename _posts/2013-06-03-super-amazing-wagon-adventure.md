I like games that you can enjoy in short amounts of time and think some of the most successful of these games somehow managed to throw massive amounts of charm at you very quicky. There was a RPG PSP game called something like 10 minute hero which I think made me realise how effective this could be  Today I played a game called super amazing wagon adventure which is another great example of how to keep your attention through 'quick fire charm'. The game fools you in to thinking its an oregon trial clone... but there is more to it than meets the eye..

This is the 360 indie version.
