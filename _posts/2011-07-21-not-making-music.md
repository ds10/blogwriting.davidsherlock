I’m taking a break from work – and also blogotron so I guess its a good time for a brain dump before I go.

I’ve become quite interested in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding">path finding</a> (<a href="http://www.lagers.org.uk/ai4g/distribution/index.html">something that has intrigued me since Peter Lager wrote a program to prove that the hobbits took the long  route through middle earth :)</a>)  since I was finding that my agents were walking into walls in my game focused agent based models.

So I booted up Unity and tried to build a game that uses the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"> A* path algorithm</a> to guide a monster through a hedge maze at night. Its actually quite difficult to make sure the monster goes the right way and I applaud all the work done by <a href="http://www.arongranberg.com/">Aron Granberg on creating the library I used</a>.

<a href="http://dailyimprovisation.blogspot.com/2011/05/depth-psychology-and-agent-based.html">Mark has been thinking about creating an agent based model</a> around Jungs idea of collective shadows, the persona and the soul image- something I tried in <a href="http://repast.sourceforge.net/">Repast</a> (but got bored before I finished). Maybe I will use this demo as a base for that. Here is the demo if you are interested:

I think these little tech demos are a way of expressing myself (even if I am the only person who plays with them!). Before Blogotron came around I was given the advice that I should make small improvisation videos of something I enjoy doing to get me into the routine of documenting my journey, I don't really think I got why until now. I'm starting to think about other ways I can use Unity and Agent based models as ways to improvise and play. I like the idea of using a game engine for such things.

I feel very tired and my brains packed and left.

EDIT: This has made me think I should play with petes pathfinding tools he wrote for processing.. too many cool things to try...
