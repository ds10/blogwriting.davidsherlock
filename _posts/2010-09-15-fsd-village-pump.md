<a href="http://fsd.cetis.ac.uk" target="_blank">The Village Pump</a> is an information hub for activities relating to the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/flexibleservicedelivery.aspx" target="_blank">Flexible Service Design programme</a>.  The hub is a go to place for FSD related articles, events and contact information. Articles in the hub are aggregated from sources using their RSS feed and currently we gather information sources such as blogs, JISCMAIL lists and forums.

We would like to populate the hub with as much useful information as possible so if you have any suggestions on sources you would like to see aggregated in to the village pump or if you are running a project blog and would like its posts to be aggregated then please comment on this entry with information and RSS feed.
