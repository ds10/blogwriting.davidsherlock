It is very easy to setup the Oculus Rift Unity 3D Plugin. I've done it on my Mac and recorded the process of putting it into a game. It's very easy to do and I just used the resource sharing centre to borrow assets from other people. All in all this takes under 5 minutes. It might even be worth doing if you haven't got your Rift yet so you can see what it's like. You do need a pro Unity account for it to work. You can get a free trial for a month (3 months if you buy the Rift). I've do some work with getting it to work with html5 for people like me who are cheapskates, but it is not as easy to build complex games in Javascript as it is with Unity. You can see examples of the html5 stuff on my youtube channel but I have not really done a tutorial yet.

Here is the video for Unity setup:

Step by step instructions:

1) <a href="http://unity3d.com/#unity-4.2">Download Unity 3D PRO trial</a>

2) <a href="https://developer.oculusvr.com/?action=dl">Sign up for a Oculus dev account and get the Unity Plugin</a>

3) Create your own scene or load a scene from the asset store

4) Install correct Unity package

5) Drag, drop and play!
