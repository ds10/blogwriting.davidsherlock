"Alright, listen to me. You go to the office where they are based, right? Before you get enter that office, you pack your Application to Register for a Professional Doctorate Award Form (R1 Form) in your bag, make sure there are no bookmarks. Then, enter the office and walk over to them at their desk. Dig out the Application to Register for a Professional Doctorate Award Form (R1 Form) and put on the desk next to them. Then you remember you should have shut the office door. Walk back towards the door to close it. Then while you walk to door check the Professor. If they don't turn away from that computer screen, lift up thatÂ Application to Register for a Professional Doctorate Award Form (R1 Form) and start to flick through it before you get back from that door, dump them."

"Just like that?"

"Listen to me, kid. If they don't reach over and flick through that Application to Register for a Professional Doctorate Award Form( R1 Form), that means they are a selfish tutor and all you're seeing is the tip of the iceberg. You dump them and you dump them fast."
