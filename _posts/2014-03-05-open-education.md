Next week is open education week. I can see signs of people gearing up do things in the spirit of open education and in the spirit of openness I’m going to post in the wrong week. A friend of mine while getting ready for some work during said week posted the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p>Tweeps do you think I am an open practitioner? Your response will help me with a couple of things for open education week</p>&mdash; Sheila MacNeill (@sheilmcn) <a href="https://twitter.com/sheilmcn/statuses/441150011049787392">March 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

This is an intriguing question and looking forward to whatever Sheila is cooking up with next week. In answer to the question I would say Sheila is a very open practitioner. I’ve worked with Sheila in the past and to be honest hadn't really been able to keep up with her  working practices. In fact, I don’t think it was until Sheila left Cetis that I really understood and missed her take on open working practices.<a href="http://howsheilaseesit.wordpress.com/">You should check out her blog</a>.

Knowing how Sheila works, my instant thought was to Tweet back “Hell Yes!”, then I thought about it for a little bit, and the medium I was saying it on. I’ve recently been reflecting on how we are all stuck in a game with services that are harming our open working practices. They are closed because their value is in the data and they are deploying mechanisms to generate the data they need to be viable.

As I sit at my desk pondering my reply to Sheila's Tweet, listening to a band named Anti-Flag though a music service that requires a log in through my Facebook account something seems wrong. I wonder about Amazon, Google, the NSA and my University both influencing our interactions with each other through technology and mining the data to control markets, society even education. I believe that education is they key to understanding what these organisations are doing to us, but there is a worry for me around the content and the feedback being delivered through an organisation or infrastructure that influence the message. My hope for open education is that it opens up opportunities to fight back against that and set the player free from the game. But while I think of my reply to Sheila's tweet I am worried about the footprint I'll leave. Will my employer see this, what will Twitter do with this information, how many characters am I allowed again?

Now that I've posted a week early in the hope the search engines have time to index it before then, edited the post after it had already gone live and waited until the optimum time to Tweet it, Maybe I'll have time to think about how technology has had an effect on my open working practices and write a post during it's proper week.
