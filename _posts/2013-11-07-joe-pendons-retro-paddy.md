My twitter profile picture is currently sporting a rather cool profile picture of a retro game version of my rabbit, Paddy. I’m very fond of it, not only because he looks super cool but also because it was designed by Joe Pendon!

I’m a big fan of Joe’s work, for those unfamiliar with him, Joe is the creator of popular web comic <a href="http://www.thepocalypse.com/">the Pocolyplse</a>; which you should check out.

Thanks Joe!
