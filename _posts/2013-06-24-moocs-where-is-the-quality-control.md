I recently saw a great article on how to create a <a href="http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/recommender-system-in-r.html">recommendation system in R</a> by yhat. I thought it looked fun and decided to hook one up myself. Thinking about datasets I started to wonder about recommendation systems that might I might use. The one that immediately sprang to mind was one based on MOOCs.

I thought a MOOC recommendation system would be a good idea because I sign up to lots of them, but complete none. I headed onto the web to find a dataset of reviews and found practically nothing! Which makes me wonder, when MOOCs are free, how do we control the quality?

Here are some things I did find.

1)Â <a href="http://coursetalk.org/">Coursetalk.or</a>g is a review and ratings site, unfortunatly to make any kind of recommendation system I'd need access to the reviews via API. Unable to find anything on the website I emailed the developer asking for access and this was the reply:

<a href="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noapi.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-145" alt="noapi" src="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/noapi.png" width="288" height="70" /></a>

2) I contacted a colleague who has been on quite a few MOOCs (and actually finished some!), who pointed to the only thing about quality in MOOCs that she knew about,<a href="http://www.icde.org/The+Quality+of+MOOCs,+an+EFQUEL+initiative.b7C_wJLQXV.ips"> an EFQUEL initiative</a>.

I feel a bit disheartened by the whole thing, for now I might have to do some screenscraping :(
