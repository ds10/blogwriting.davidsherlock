Being new to R I found it hard to get what I want out of dataframes. I stumbled across a package called <a href="https://code.google.com/p/sqldf/">SQLDF</a> which lets you use SQL statements (SQLite syntax I think) to  query the dataframes by replacing table names are replaced with data frame names.

While this might not be a good option in the long term it has certainly helped me get my head around things.

Here is a video of me getting started:
