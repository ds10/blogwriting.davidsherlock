I feel my last few posts have been a <a title="Admit it, David! You think education sounds like crap too!" href="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/admit-it-david-you-think-education-sounds-like-crap-too/">bit negative,</a> I need to cheer up a little, find some good in the world. How about this video of chap wearing a playable Gameboy costume at Ohayocon 2014. It was apparently done using a Raspberry Pi, you can switch games and everything. Now I need to hunt the guy down and find out just how he did it. I would wear this to work.
