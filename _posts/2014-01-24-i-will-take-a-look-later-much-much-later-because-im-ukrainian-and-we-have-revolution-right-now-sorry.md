I've seen some odd things in ticketing systems before. But Github user fre5h on his Github repository took it to things to a new level. I guess sometimes you see situations on the news that are happening but when it doesn't effect you directly it goes out of your mind as quick as it went in and that life goes on as normal; not really giving a thought to what's actually happening to people in these situations. Anyhow, fre5h received a pull request on one of his repositories a few days ago but unfortunately was a bit too busy to do anything about it:

For those whose news feeds have been full of Justin Beiber's DUI the BBC have ran <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25182823">a good FAQ on Ukraine standoff</a> is all about. Also, <a href=" https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12">ere is the page with the pull request. </a>The comments have been hijacked by well wishers. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1w17qn/iama_protestor_in_kyiv_ukraine/">There is also a good AMA over at Reddit with a protestor.</a>
