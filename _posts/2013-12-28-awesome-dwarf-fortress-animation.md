Those that play Dwarf Fortress will know that the game is filled with stories; the difficulty getting those stories across to non-players is the fact that the stories exist as a mix of moving ASCII characters, text and applied imagination. There are some really neat examples of stories been told in a comic book style,<a href="http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/DF2010:Stories/Bronzemurder"> such as the Bronze Murder art</a> that can be found here. Video wise I haven't seen much but youtuber user <a dir="ltr" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/RiqCrow?feature=watch" data-sessionlink="ei=2oHBUqfqFIi88wPXh4GQBA&amp;feature=watch" data-ytid="UC7rJTlj1f1nXtM1CEmt_amA" data-name="watch">RiqCrow</a> created a short animation showing the story of a ghostly miner in a fortress he played. What's really nice about the video is that it fits the Dwarf Fortress style perfectly, it's very well done but comes across as low tech. I love the gritty voices. Enjoy:
