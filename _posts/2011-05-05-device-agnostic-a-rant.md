Although I loath doing any kind of design work, one of my pet hates at the moment is still the term 'Mobile First'. The idea from what I can gather is that web designers should make sure that all their content is designed for mobile devices and then can scale up for desktops.

I don't mind the idea that designers should be trying to make their content available on as many platforms as possible- I think that's great! It is simply the name that makes many designers think that Mobile devices are the new 'desktop'.

For years websites have been designed with computer desktops in mind and now many  organizations are now scrabbling to redesign with 'Mobile First' principles.  I worry that the term will make designers concentrate on the mobile experience and not learn from the past mistake of designing for one audience. What happens when the next device comes along, do we redesign it for that?

I much prefer the term device agnostic, I think we should try to make sites work on as many devices as possible.

There are many devices I browse the web on more often than my mobile phone, some large some small:
<ul>
	<li>TV</li>
	<li>PS3</li>
	<li>PSP</li>
	<li>DS</li>
	<li>Wii</li>
</ul>
Is having a small screen the only thing to take in to consideration? Many moons ago I helped design the JISC CETIS site and the thing I hate about it most isn't the fact it doesn't work on small screens but the fact I can't browse it very well with a joypad/tv controller!
