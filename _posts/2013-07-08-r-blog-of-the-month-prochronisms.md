A vistor of the blog and 'all round stack overflow good guy' Ben Marwick pointed me in the direction of the fantastic blog:<em> <a href="http://www.prochronism.com/">Prochronisms. or: Downton Crabbey. Using TV anachronisms to learn about changes in language, and trying to avoid complete curmudgeonhood in the process</a></em>. From what I can gather <a href="https://plus.google.com/108075792286211090044/posts">Ben Schmidt</a> takes scripts of modern TV shows based in historical setting and then compares the use of language to that in  Google Ngram database of books.
<p style="text-align: left;">While the blog is humorous and the idea itself is light hearted it turns out there is a lot to be learnt about the change in English language over the past 100 years or so. I have not had time to read all the posts in details, but my <a href="http://www.prochronism.com/2012/04/mad-men-3-get-off-phone.html">early favourite is get off the phone</a></p>
I'd love to play with the Google Ngram database myself and will be having a poke around it some time. There appears to be some code on his other site, <a href="http://sappingattention.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/poor-mans-sentiment-analysis.html">sapping attention</a>. I am wondering how he queries such a big database, I might ask him...
