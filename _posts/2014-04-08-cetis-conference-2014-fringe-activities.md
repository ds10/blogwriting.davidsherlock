Registration has now opened on the Cetis site for the <a href="http://www.cetis.ac.uk/2014-cetis-conference/">CETIS 2014 conference</a>. From the Cetis site:
<blockquote>Each year the Cetis conference provides a unique opportunity for developers, learning technologists, lectures and policy makers to come together to discuss recent innovations in the domain of education technology. This year’s conference focuses on the digital institution and explores how technology innovation can support and develop every aspect of university and college life, for teachers and learners, researchers and developers, service directors and senior managers.</blockquote>
The Cetis conference is a great place to meet people doing similar things and have a natter about the important stuff.  This year the conference takes place on the 17th and 18th of June and  is being held Bolton and since you'll be coming to Bolton you might as well make the most of your time here to explore 'Britain's Friendliest Town'.
