Over the last few days a social experiment took place. Tech blogger Andy Baio called it the “most wonderful thing online now”, it shot to the top of BBC and The Guardians most read articles, there is even an XKCD comic about. Meanwhile I’m messing around with Twitter <a title="Generate data for me to sell, based around generated data for us to sell, based around data generated for them to sell" href="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/generate-data-for-me-to-sell-based-around-generated-data-for-us-to-sell-based-around-data-generated-for-them-to-sell/">thinking about how it’s closed data model is creating more businesses around closed data models.</a>

The whole thing had flown me right by, I mean I had some awareness something  was going on, but I wasn’t paying attention, and now I’ve missed it. I went to a conference last week on Gaming for Social change and it wasn’t mentioned there; I work in an environment which we call “education technology” and it wasn’t on my radar. I was too busy messing with Twitter lists.

The social experiment in question was “Twitch plays Pokémon” and involved around an estimated 658,000 people. The idea is simple; a single game of Pokemon is played in a chatroom (on Twitch) Players tell the game what they want it to do. It took 400+ hours for them to finish what is a 10ish hour game; the responses, memes, cartoons and work that came from the experiment are amazing and spreading around the Internet like wildfire.

I haven’t made sense out of what has gone on here, but I know it’s important. I know that it is based around play, communication, technology and learning, I know its based around all the things in education that I think matter. I’m annoyed because all those things are important to me and the kids just went and did it while I was too busy thinking about ways to get kids to go and do it.

I think the key is that in such a short amount of time players have gone away and created content around the activity. I am particularly a fan of the cult of the Helix fossil. If one single thing my institution did got that much participation around an online learning activity the world would end, yet it was so.. simple!

Here is a video of some captures of the game in action:

There is another game starting in 23 hours. Maybe I'll work it all out then.
