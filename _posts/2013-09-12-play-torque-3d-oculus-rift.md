I haven't had time to try Torque 3D with the Oculus Rift, but it seems a very quick, easy and free way to start developing for my Oculus Rift.You'll need:
<ol>
	<li>Torque 3D : <a href="http://mit.garagegames.com/Torque3D-3-0.zip">http://mit.garagegames.com/Torque3D-3-0.zip</a></li>
	<li>Torque 3d Rift Template: <a href="http://mit.garagegames.com/Rift-Template-3-0.zip">http://mit.garagegames.com/Rift-Template-3-0.zip</a></li>
	<li>Oculus VR SDK which you should get from logging in to your developer account.</li>
</ol>
The jist is this. The rift template goes inside the template folder in Torque. When you create a new project you need to select this template and add the Oculus SDK as a module. You'll also need to change teh movement type so it supports the rift.  Wpparently that's all, it seemed to work for me. I made a video of the setup :
