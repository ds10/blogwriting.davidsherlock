What’s the point? syndrome is a psychological disorder encountered by individuals who do not know what their employable future holds and also shared by individuals who took a job in the hope of helping little people prepare for their future lives only to have that dreams shattered by somebody in government who looks like Pod. It is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms including cba and icbf’d, Northeners  also report symptoms of “canny b”.

It is common among zero hour contract tutors, unpaid interns, dissertation interns, rolling contract employees or anybody who works for an organisation where a new exec has ordered newly created strategic objectives and themes. Newly qualified teachers have a 100%  positive test rate. ‘Having a good bitch during break’ and monster.co.uk can provided temporary relief.

It’s very hard to work when you’re not sure what the future holds. In a way I’m extremely lucky to have held a job that I enjoy for 6 years, this job is a yearly contract, which runs through July-July around this time of year without fail I feel what’s the point syndrome. This year the situation makes things particularly bad, should I really be interested in the work I do not knowing how long it will be carrying on, should I bother carrying on with my R1 PhD form when I probably won’t be here in August? Fortunately working in education sometimes helps spur me on to do the ‘right’ thing for students I work with; but unfortunately my morals sometimes takes second place to worrying about paying the rent.  This got me thinking that it would be nice to earn enough that the only thing you had to worry about was your morals, ya’know like Bank CEO’s, Vice Chancellors and the Security of State for Education do.

Break times nearly over, best get back to work.
