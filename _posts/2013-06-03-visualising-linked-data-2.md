I did a short video showing how I create a visual Graph from dbpedia data. In this video I use SPARQL to query a triple-store endpoint, then I take the results, spruce them up in Google Refine and explore the graph in Gephi.

I've explored the relationship between members of punk rock bands, but the principle can be applied to any similar dataset.
