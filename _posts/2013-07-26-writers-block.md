Currently I'm trying to get into Shiny and R. I'm trying to build an app that plugs into a PHP app that I am currently writing (or rather rewriting). Progress is not fast. Currently I have the error message on my screen that looks like this:
<blockquote>Error : evaluation nested too deeply: infinite recursion / options(expressions=)?</blockquote>
It's something to do with ggplot and my reactive output variables.

I feel stupid. Should it be taking me this long to create my app? In an attempt to take my mind away from the problem I decided to spend a morning learning something new. The morning was then promptly wasted looking for things to learn about.

There is lots of interesting stuff out there. I'm just failing to get in to it. Maybe I seek too immediate awards. At least I got a form for my PhD out the way yesterday.
