Our department have started work on a new exciting new project called RAGE, which stands for Realising an Applied Gaming Ecosystem. When I tell anybody I'm working on this they kind of get this idea that it is a project about gaming, but they are not really sure what 'applied gaming' is, to be honest, before I started the project I didn't have an idea either. Before starting the project I would have said that applied gaming was a modern word for 'serious games', but I have since changed my game, perhaps a game doesn't have to be designed with serious intent to be educational, Minecraft seems to be used in many educational settings successfully.

At the kick off meeting for the project we asked 28 people (28 people working on the project)  what they thought applied gaming was and funnily enough we got 28 very different answers. We asked them what industry they worked in and to explain the term 'allied games' in one sentence. I haven't really got my head around it yet, but it seems that many people also have a link between serious games and applied games in their minds. Here are the answers:
