For the last hour I have been getting the following error using gource on Mac OS X. The problem seems to a problem with gource itself rather than the input as I was getting the error even when just running the command without any inputs. After messing with homebew I discovered that the errors lies with Mac OS X, and seems to be a problem introduced with Maverick.

Solution: The error occurs when I am using dual monitors, the short term fix is to use 1 monitor, or move the terminal on to my laptop screen.
