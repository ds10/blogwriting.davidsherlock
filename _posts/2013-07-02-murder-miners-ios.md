A <a href="murder miners">few weeks I had a quick play on a halo/minecraft</a> cross breed game called Murder Miners. It was pretty fun so I decided to check out the developers site,<a href="http://jforcegames.com"> J Force Games.</a> Â  Two things I found interesting on the site.

1 There's a PC version in development, <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128361360http://">you can greenlight it here</a>

2. According to<a href="http://jforcegames.com/blog/index.php?itemid=268"> this blog post</a>, there is an iOS version in development

I'm pretty pleased that they are porting the game. It seemed a pretty good game but my worry was how long it would last on Microsofts extremely under supported Xbox live indie game platform. I guess Microsofts lack of support for developers like J Force is forcing them to jump ship.
