At first glance it would be easy to dismiss Murder Miners as simply a minecraft rip off. While there is clearly lots of inspiration gained from Minecraft, Murder Miners is geared towards pvp deathmatch instead of Mining and building. My favourite mode is called Zombie and starts of with simple NPC zombies charging at a human team. As humans die they join the zombie team until everybody is dead. Lots of fun.
