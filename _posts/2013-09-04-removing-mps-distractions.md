I had toyed with the idea that the UK wide porn filter might lead to a <a href="http://davidsherlock.co.uk/the-great-revolution/">Civ style golden age leading to new forms of governance</a>. My thinking behind this was that the everyday man might find themselves less distracted and lead them to do great things. However, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23954447">an article from the BBC </a>released today suggests that MPs themselves might need the distraction removed as apparently there are 300 000 requests for porn coming from the houses of parliament this year! So perhaps we don't need new governance structures, perhaps the old ones are fine and the people in government were just distracted to do a proper job.

I'm sure theres lots of comment on the web about porn blocking measures and this article.
