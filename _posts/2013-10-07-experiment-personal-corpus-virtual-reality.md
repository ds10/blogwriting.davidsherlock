My Oculus Rift arrived and I've had a go at translating the Personal Corpus to a 3d World. I've not really got very far at the moment but the hope is to be read information from the users personal corpus and let them experiment with it in real time. To be honest I don't think the way I am doing this works very well. But you have to kick a few tires to know the best course of action.
