I volenteered to help write a briefing paper on analytic tools in the hope of stealing some time to play with cool stuff. The joy of having some play time in work quickly evaporated when it struck me that not only is there a very large number of tools but also that they come from communities of such diverse practices.   It was quickly evident that creating a full list of tools would be impossible and almost certainly out of date the moment it was released.

As such, Wilbert and I have opted to provide a map of communities with information on landmark tools hoping to guide the you to a community, tool, or set of tools that fits your needs.

The briefing paper “<a href="http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/2013/535">Analytics Tools and Infrastructure</a>” has just been released and is tenth in the <a href="http://publications.cetis.ac.uk/c/analytics">CETIS Analytics Series.</a>
